Comment: History of development and ownership
 .
 Customizer is copyright by Ivailo Monev, et al.
 .
 From 2010 to 2013, Customizer was developed and maintained
 by Ivailo Monev and few contributors. The program was
 initially written in Bash, Zenity and Gambas. In 2012,
 Gambas 3 port was created by Thiago Abreu (pr#17).
 .
 In 2013, Ivailo Monev had transferred the ownership of
 repository to Mubiin Kimura. Development was less active
 until late 2014.
 .
 In 2015, Customizer was rewritten in Python by Ivailo Monev
 In same year, Python 3 support was added by Graham Cantin
 (pr#110) while continue to depend on Python 2.7.
 .
 From 2016, Customizer was forked and maintained by Graham
 Cantin with no further planned migration. As a result,
 Customizer had two sources: official fork that handles
 future development and the original repository that is
 considered as "old stable".
 .
 As January 2017, both official fork and "old stable" were
 deprecated and Mubiin Kimura has transferred the original
 repository to Graham Cantin.
